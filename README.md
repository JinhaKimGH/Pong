# Pong
The Pong Game

Controls:

W & A to move the blue paddle up and down.
Up & Down arrows to move the orange paddle up and down.
Space to start the game.

Note: 

You don't need setup.py or the Pong.icns file, they're only to make it an actual application instead of just a program. You can also use any .icns file as long as its named Pong.icns for the setup. In order to make it an app, in the terminal, in the correct directory, type python3.7 setup.py py2app -A

Make sure to have the py2app and pygame modules.
