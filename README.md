You don't need setup.py or the Pong.icns file, they're only to make it an actual application. You can also use any .icns file as long as its named Pong.icns for the setup. In order to make it an app in terminal when you're in the directory type python3.7 setup.py py2app -A

Make sure to have the p2app module.
